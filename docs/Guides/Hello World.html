<p>The source code for this guide can be found <a href="https://github.com/litlang/demo_hello_world">here</a>.</p>
<p>1) Install <a href="">litc</a></p>
<p>2) Clone this repository</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">  $ git clone git@github.com:CaptainCharlieGreen/lit_hello_world.git
</code></pre>
<p>2) Run litc build in the cloned directory:</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">  $ litc build ./HelloWorld.lit
</code></pre>
<p>4) Run litc deploy on the built .sys file:</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">  $ litc deploy ./HelloWorld.sys
</code></pre>
<p>5) Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser, or use curl:</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">  $ curl localhost:3000
</code></pre>
<h1 id="thebasics">The Basics</h1>
<p>Lit is all about "events", "functions", and "services".  Its sole purpose is to describe what events and functions exist in your system and how those events are handled by those functions.</p>
<p>An "event" is a single piece of serialized data that is passed into your system.  Events come from "sources", and in this example we're including "Http", which is the event source for http requests provided by lit's standard library.  Including Http tells lit that the HelloWorld service accepts http events, or in more familiar terms, that the HelloWorld service is a web server.</p>
<p>A "function" is a single computational unit within your system, and it represents the actual infrastructure that gets deployed.  Functions accept events and execute code, and "services" are groupings of functions that control access to these infrastructure components.</p>
<p>The first step is to run lit build, which creates a .sys file, which is a deployable bundle of the entire system.  Sys files can be moved from computer to computer and contain version and other metadata about your system that make them ideal CI/CD artifacts.  Then, we deploy that sys file to the "local" substrate defined in ligconfig.json.  We could also deploy that same sys file to the AWS substrate, but we'll keep things simple for now.</p>
<h2 id="linebylinebreakdown">Line by line breakdown</h2>
<pre><code>service HelloWorld {
</code></pre>
<p>Here we declare a service HelloWorld.  All functions must reside within a service.</p>
<h3 id=""> </h3>
<pre><code>include "Http"
</code></pre>
<p>Including Http lets us recieve Http events and tells lit this is a web server</p>
<h3 id="-1"> </h3>
<pre><code>Http { method: "get", path: "\*" } -&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is an "event description", and its semantics are determined by the Http event source.  The gist here is we're describing what type of Http event should be sent to the following function.  This can be translated as "All Http get requests should be sent to the following function".</p>
<h3 id="-2"> </h3>
<pre><code>helloWorld ():any -&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is a function signature, complete with a function name, input type within the parens (in this case, no input type), and output type after the colon.  Types are not implemented yet in lit, so this function returns the any type while in the future it will return "string".</p>
<h3 id="-3"> </h3>
<pre><code>"./helloWorld.js"
</code></pre>
<p>This is the final part of a function definition--the artifact.  This is the code that will be run in response to the http event declared above.  For now, assume that this .js file will be run by NodeJs…somewhere…more on code execution <a href="">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="whatdidthisdo">What did this do?</h2>
<p>You may notice that new build/ directory--feel free to poke around.  You can find our friendly helloWorld.js file copied to build/{build_id}/HelloWorld-helloWorld/helloWorld.js with a bunch of stuff copied around it.  That stuff is the "host", which is a part of the lit "runtime".  The host's job is to interface with whatever infrastructure your code is running on and move events to and from your code.</p>
<p>The Http event source also created a web server using NodeJS's Http library, which is what you're visiting when you navigate to localhost:3000.  The other top level directory (HelloWorld-lit<em>generated</em>proxy_Http) was also built by the Http source to work with the web server to determine what code should be executed in response to what requests.</p>
<p>All together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Http created a web server running on port 3000</li>
<li>Http created a proxy function that receives all requests from that web server and routes requests to lit functions within the HelloWorld service</li>
<li>The NodeJS host receives all get requests, invokes user code (helloWorld.js), and sends the responses back to the http proxy</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="aws">AWS</h1>
<p>Now that you're acquainted with the basics of lit, lets do something more exciting--run this on real, production worthy infrastructure.</p>
<p>1) If you don't already have an AWS account that you can fool around with, create one.  Everything we're about to do falls well within AWS free tier limits.</p>
<p>2) Change litconfig.json to be:</p>
<pre><code class="json language-json">{
  "substrate": "aws",
  "aws": {
    "config": {
      "region": "us-west-2"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: everything within the "config" hash is passed into the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Config.html">AWS.Config</a> method of the AWS SDK, so you can add and change things as needed (for instance, you can change the region to "us-west-1").</p>
<p>3) Lit will need to create resources on your AWS account and will need credentials to do that.  There are two ways it can access those credentials.  You need to do at least one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A) Supply AWS credentials within the litconfig.json</p>
<ul>
<li>add these two properties to the config hash in litconfig.json:</li>
<li>"accessKeyId": "{your access key id}",</li>
<li>"secretAccessKey": "{your secret access key}"</li></ul></li>
<li><p>B) Have lit use your shared ~/.aws/credentials file</p>
<ul>
<li>follow the instructions to create a shared credentials file <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-shared.html">here</a>.  Note: you may already have one--try</li>
<li><code>bash
$ stat ~/.aws/credentials
</code></li></ul>
<p>NOTE: credentials provided through A override B.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>4) In the future, lit will create appropriate roles for each resource it creates.  Today, you need to create a role with some basic permissions for lit to use when creating resources.  Create an IAM role with the following policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWSLambdaFullAccess</li>
<li>AmazonS3FullAccess</li>
<li>InvokeAllLambda</li>
</ul>
<p>And make sure the role is assumable by Lambda and ApiGateway:</p>
<pre><code class="json language-json">{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "lambda.amazonaws.com",
          "apigateway.amazonaws.com"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, add this role's arn to litconfig.json at the path aws/preCreatedRole.  Your litconfig.json should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="json language-json">{
  "substrate": "aws",
  "aws": {
    "config": {
      "region": "us-west-2"
    },
    "preCreatedRole": "{arn for the role you just created}"
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>5) Run lit deploy (we don't need to build again--we can use the same .sys file!)</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">  $ litc deploy ./HelloWorld.sys
</code></pre>
<h2 id="checkitout">Check it out</h2>
<p>Inside your AWS console you can see lit created a single lambda function and an APIGateway API called "HelloWorld".  You can invoke the system by navigating to the url APIGateway generates for you.  You can find this under the stages tab on the left of the APIGateway console for HelloWorld.</p>
